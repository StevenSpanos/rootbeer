<h1 style="text-align: center;">Root Beer</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Despite what you may know, root beer is very important to the world's wellbeing and very existance.<br> 
    If it weren't for root beer, you (yes, you!) wouldn't exist.<br>
    You don't have to thank root beer, it knows you're thankful<br>
    Despite how it may seem, root beer is not a deity and will never be, that'd be false idolism and isn't acceptable among the root beer cause<br>
    As stated in <em>Stargazer</em> by popular band Rainbow, "Where was your star? Was it far? Was it far? Was it far?".<br>
    This is a reference to the fact that you should not believe in false idols.<br>
    An example of a false idol is Big Cola. Please refer to the Big Cola page for more info</p>
