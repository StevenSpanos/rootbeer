<h1 style="text-align: center;">About</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Root beer is a soft drink made from the root bark of the sassafras tree. <br>
    Root beer is typically, but not exclusively, non-alcoholic, caffeine-free, sweet, and carbonated. Like cola, it usually has a thick and foamy head. Unlike cola, it isn’t pure evil. <br>
    Root beer was commercially invented in the 18th century, but was made well before then as medicine for Native Americans. <br>
    Charles Elmer Hires was the first to successfully commercialize root beer in 1876. Later on, Pepsi started making root beer to rival against Hires’, labeled Barq’s. <br>
    Despite being well known as a rival against Coca Cola, it isn’t. Pepsi Co and Coca Cola combine to form Big Cola. <br>
    Big Cola is the darkness to the light that is A&W. <br>
    A&W was invented in 1919, in order to combat the rising evil that is Big Cola, and since then, the fight has continued.<br>
    This is the only place where you can find this information, since Big Cola has a firm grasp on the United States of America. <br>
    Many people, including possibly you, have been brainwashed by Big Cola to do their bidding. <br>
    However, you can revert. It’s the only way. As Harlan Ellison tried to convey when writing hit movie The Terminator, if you allow Big Cola to slip under the shadows, it will bring the end of the world, full of torture and suffering. <br>
    A&W, among others (not including Mug and Barq’s, they’re Big Cola), is the only resistance we have. <br>
